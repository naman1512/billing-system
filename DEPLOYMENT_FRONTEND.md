## üöÄ Vercel Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production ready: Fixed undefined values, enhanced signature loading, removed serial numbers"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables in Vercel**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy from your main branch
   - Check the deployment logs for any issues
   - Test all functionality on the live site

## üîß Post-Deployment

1. **Test All Features**
   - [ ] Company creation/management
   - [ ] Invoice creation
   - [ ] PDF preview and download
   - [ ] Email sending
   - [ ] Dashboard functionality
   - [ ] Signature display in PDFs

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [ ] Check Vercel analytics
   - [ ] Monitor build times
   - [ ] Check Core Web Vitals

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Considerations

- The app currently references a backend at localhost - update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL after backend deployment
- Email functionality requires valid Gmail app password
- PDF signature loading has fallback mechanisms for different hosting environments
- File uploads are handled by the backend, ensure proper CORS configuration

## üîÑ Updates After Backend Deployment

After your backend is deployed to Render, update the environment variable:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api
```
